- User Journeys (key user flows)
- Design Requirements (UX principles, accessibility)
- Technical Considerations (platform, integrations, security)
- Timeline/Milestones
- Success Metrics
- Risks/Mitigation

Be specific with concrete examples and numbers. Use search_web_summarized with "key findings" parameter to research efficiently without context overflow.
"""

# Critic agent prompt - simplified to around 100 words

- Feasibility (timeline realism, technical considerations, implementation challenges)
- User-centricity (persona realism, problem-solution fit, journey completeness)
- Market relevance (research depth, competitive landscape, differentiation)
- Measurability (success metrics, KPI relevance, tracking plans)

"""

6. Ensuring technical feasibility with implementation details
7. Strengthening user personas with behavioral insights
